# November 18 Update

We have released Fana API v2.2 filled with new features and bug fixes based on your feedback which has been very helpful!

## Added Search End-point
We've been hard at work on making sure that the API is easy to use and gives you the most relevant data. In the last few weeks, we've added a search end-point so that you can get posts that contain particular keywords like "Keyword" or "#news".
> For more information and direction on how it works read the [Documentation](/end-point/search  "Search Documentation").
